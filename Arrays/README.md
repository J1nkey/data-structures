## Arrays

**Definition**: Arrays are a collection of elements of the same data type. They're used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements.

In programming, we specific the size/length of array for telling the compiler to take a corresponding memory sizes for representing array.

**Example**: we initialize a array with type is integer and size of it is 5. As we know, int type will take a 4 bytes in memory for representing values. So for now, the compiler know, let me take 5 (size value) * 4 (integer size) for the integer array. And the array can store 5 values. The memory will take for array is sequential.

0x0000 - 0x0004 - 0x0008 - 0x0012 - 0x0016 => 5 cells in RAM for representing the array.

Take care of, the array index always begin at 0.
